IMPORTANT guidelines to be followed for EVERY code addtions or code fixing in the coversation- 

1. need to enhence the working code to the next level, without distruping the working one.
2. look carefully if that feature is already implementedensure to update /implement the new or existing UI in every phase as you move on, so that i can test it as u make progress before starting. 
3. if u want to add/delete any files do state the summerised reasonings in a single line
4. we need to pull actual data from the Onet source website using API ONLY. no dummpy/mock data pls. 
5. we will use the internal broweser based storage if needed. rest all will be API data fecting to serve the needs...
Most importantly before you fix issues have a look at the complete codebase for every phase @codebase before you start making changes.
