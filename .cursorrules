IMPORTANT guidelines to be followed for EVERY code addtions or code fixing in the coversation- 

1. need to enhence the working code to the next level, without distruping the working one. Most importantly before you fix issues have a look at the complete @codebase before you start making changes
2. look carefully if that feature is already implemented, if so need not to craete duplicates. If you see the duplicacy, pls ensure to point out the ame and remove those. 
3. Its important to ensure to update /implement the new or existing UI in every phase as you move on, so that i can test it as u make progress. 
3. if u want to add or create or delete/duplicate any files do state the reasons clearly
4. we need to pull actual data from the respective source website using API ONLY. no dummpy/mock data pls. 
5. we will use the internal broweser based storage if needed. rest all will be API data fecting to serve the needs.
